title: Why is Myspace so slow?
---

Yes, that is a rhetorical question.  I know why.
The question isn't so much why, it's more how the hell do so many people sit on MySpace and Facebook when their sites are slow as shit?

Seriously, taking a couple seconds to load _each page_?  What is this, the days of dialup?
Drop some of the flash and javascript bullshit you've over-laiden your site with, and maybe it would run faster.

Disgusting.
