Alright, so I bit the bullet and did the Myspace and Facebook thing.
You can find me on Myspace at http://www.myspace.com/512643590

You can find me on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?ref=name&id=100000562880858


There.  Now you internet people can find me, see me, message me, touch yourselves at night while thinking about me, whatever you like.  Play safe :)

The best way to get in touch with me is still via Email, Phone, and Text, in that order.
